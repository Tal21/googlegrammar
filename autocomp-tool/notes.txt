- Finished implementing auto completion for one word and full sentences.

- SpellChecker compiles, runtime error where it spellchecks "no" when user
  is asked if they want to add the word to the dictionary.

5/13/2022
- SpellChecker suggests words, but it needs some work
    * Maybe try to find a word in a word (ex: "hello" in "hellow")
    * Maybe constrain the length to a one or two difference / margin of error
      (ex: "hellow" would not suggest "h.", but would suggest "hello" or "bellow")

- Attempting to input an HTML entry as a parameter of a Java file.

    * Suggest words (eg: Did you mean... __?)
- Grammar checker!
